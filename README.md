# JEJU-DLCAMP

This repository is about the project during **DEEP LEARNING CAMP JEJU ( 2018. 7. 1 ~ 30 )**

## Motivation of Project

Jeju Island POI(point-of-interst) [Dataset](https://www.data.go.kr/dataset/15004770/fileData.do)

</p>

Sometime it really hard to find proper place to go.

What if, the Model can understand where do i want to go and understand location of the place in the map ?

The Model will be able to recommend a suitable place according to the **Location** you are currently in and **Keyword** you want to go.
<br/><br/><br/>


## Model Architecture

We using [Relation Networks](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7082-a-simple-neural-network-module-for-relational-reasoning) basically contains **CNN** for Image processing, and **RN** for Relational reasoning between two object(Image, Text).

</p>

And also using [Wild Relation Network](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/santoro18a.html) for improve the recommendation accuracy.

## Dataset

The data contains the following information

* User Location
* Image Location (Center, Boundary)
* Place Information (type [Restaurant, Cafe, ...], Location [Latitude, Longitude])


At the beginning of the project, I decided to only consider the POI for restaurant and cafe in Jeju Island. Each **Image** has a number of POIs which marked with red(restaurant), green(cafe) marker.

Also, the center(user position) **location** of the image, boundary location information and the location information of restaurant and cafe in Jeju Island are required for input.

Among the various **Keyword**, I will focus on the following Keyword first.<br/>
* Restaurant ?
* Cafe ?
* Beachfront ?
* Near ?
* Cafe nearby restaurant ?
* Restaurant nearby cafe ?

The possible **Answer** is a softmax vector whose with probability for POIs

*[probability of POI 1, probability of POI 2, probability of POI 3,...,probability of POI n]*

## Experiment

### 2 - Class Dataset

</p>
At the begining of the Project, to make sure the Relation Network working well for our Project we tried very simple problem that have only 2 class.


### Result (Training)

</p></br>

### Result (Testing)

| | RN model | Baseline model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accuracy | **82%** | 74% |

</br></br></br>

### 10 - Class Dataset
<p align="center">
    <img src="Figure/10class_dataset_1.png" height="350"/>
</p>
First task of the Project, we take only 10 places that located in the map and recommend the places to the user which are highly related with user's keyword.

### Result (Training)

</p></br>

### Result (Testing)

| | WReN model | RN model | Baseline model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Top - 1 Accuracy | **33%** | 20% | 0% |
| Top - 3 Accuracy | **76%** | 70% | 70% |
